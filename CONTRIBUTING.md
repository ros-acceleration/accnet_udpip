## Commit Message Guidelines

This project follows the **Conventional Commits** specification.

Commit messages **must** follow this format:

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Common Types

* `feat`: A new feature
* `fix`: A bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation-only changes
* `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change)
* `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `perf`: Performance improvement
* `test`: Adding or correcting tests
* `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies
* `ci`: Changes to CI configuration or scripts
* `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

* `feat(runtime): add async execution support`
* `fix(memory): prevent buffer overflow on edge case`
* `docs: update installation instructions`

### Additional Rules

* Use the imperative mood in the description.
* Keep the description concise and meaningful.
* Reference related issues when applicable (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
* Breaking changes must be clearly indicated using `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request:

* Clearly describe **what** the change does and **why** it is needed.
* Reference related issues or discussions.
* Indicate whether the change is breaking or backward-compatible.
* Be prepared to address feedback and make revisions.

All pull requests are subject to review and approval by maintainers appointed by **Accelerat** and **AMD**.
